=back

=head2 2013-12-13

=over

=item * Added omnipitr-backup-cleanup - program to remove old backups, and
xlogs from walarchive, leaving consistent state (all backups can be restored
using xlogs from walarchive).

=back

=head2 2013-12-12

=over

=item * Added timezone and hostname information to meta files

=back

=head2 2013-12-10

=over

(from 30). This is to make sure that the cache file will not be too big.

=back

=head2 2013-11-29

=over

information when backup has started, and what is the minimal xlog file
required for recovery from it.

=over

=item * Add option to make omnipitr-restore able to remove files from walarchive
before serving next xlog to PostgreSQL. This is important in cases where slave
falls back a lot, and it's catching up - but it doesn't start to remove old,
obsolete wal segments before it will fully catch up. Now, with new option
(--remove-before) it will delete old wal segments during catchup phase too.
